# Changelog

### v0.2.0

BREAKING CHANGES:

- The `debug` task helper has been replaced with a `logger` helper which is a `Logger` instance (see README)
- The `-1` shortcut for "run once" never worked; it has been removed
- Unrecognised command-line arguments will now cause an error to be thrown

New features:

- Added `--schema-only` CLI flag for installing/updating the schema (running migrations) only
- It's now possible to override how logs are output by supplying a `logFactory` (see README)
- `query` helper reduces boilerplate

Fixes:

- We never needed `uuid-ossp` so we've removed the requirement (you may want to remove the extension from your DB manually)
